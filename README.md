# PeAr_Calculator
The Perimeter-Area (PeAr) Calculator is a Java script that allows to estimate the perimeter and area of 2D geometrical figures.
The user is granted the possibility to choose, at the start, how many geometrical figures he/she wants to have the perimeter and area calculated. 

# Milestones 
1. November, 17 2018: PeAr Calculator
   - minimally funtioning code

# Versions
## Version 1.0.0 (November, 17 2018)
- 3 geometrical figures (square, circle and rectangle).
## Version 1.0.1 (December, 12 2018)
- added triangle (the code exploits the Heron formula for the area, therefore one must type in the size of all sides).
